  <h1>Starting Small, Dreaming Big</h1>
  <p><em>May 28, 2025</em></p>

  <p>
    I never thought building my first portfolio site would make me feel so... proud and terrified at the same time.
    Just a few weeks ago, I was sitting in bed (probably too late at night), wondering if I was even cut out for this creative industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    But here I am — with a working site, my own custom blog, and a real job that I landed doing what I love. 
    I’ve already been through an intense internship, designed for a real estate brand, and I’m currently running social media for a trampoline park (yup).
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s not always easy. Some days I feel like I’m barely keeping up. But I keep reminding myself:
    <strong>you don’t need to be perfect — just brave enough to keep showing up.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is more than a portfolio. It’s proof that I’ve already started. 
    I’ll look back on this post someday — and smile at how far I’ve come.
  </p>

  <p>Thanks for being here.</p>
